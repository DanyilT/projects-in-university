If you attempt the Many-Time-Pad challenge, you must implement your own Python script to recover the plaintexts — do **not** copy a complete script from the internet or submit third-party solutions as your work. Reasonable use of standard Python libraries (for example: `itertools`, `collections`, `numpy`, `bitarray`, or **PyCryptodome** for low-level primitives) is permitted, but the core attack logic (XOR handling, crib testing, plaintext reconstruction, scoring, etc.) **must** be your original code. You may use online crib-dragging tools as an auxiliary aid to identify likely plaintext fragments, but any use of such tools must be fully documented in your report (tool name, inputs, outputs, and how you incorporated the result into your script).
