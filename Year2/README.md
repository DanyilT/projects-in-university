## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my academic projects for Year 2. The projects are organized by semester and subject, showcasing a range of skills and knowledge acquired throughout my studies.

## [Semester 1](/Year2/Sem1/)

### [GUI Programming](/Year2/Sem1/GUI%20Programming)

This section includes a collection of lab exercises and coursework assignments focused on GUI programming. Each project within this category is designed to enhance understanding of various GUI design principles and their applications in creating user-friendly interfaces.

### [Information Technology Maths](/Year2/Sem1/Information%20Technology%20Maths)

Projects in this semester introduce fundamental mathematical concepts used in information technology. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including discrete mathematics, probability, and statistics.

### [Interactive Multimedia](/Year2/Sem1/Interactive%20Multimedia)

This is about Unity 3d Engine and how to create a game or any application using it. You can see some of my projects in this [repository](https://github.com/DanyilT/Unity-babysitter). Also you can read more about my projects for this module in this [markdown file](Sem1/Interactive%20Multimedia/CreateWithCode.md), there is no files in this folder because all of them are in the repository mentioned above, work for  this module are [here](https://github.com/DanyilT/Unity-babysitter/tree/Junior-Programmer/Create%20with%20Code) (withot final project).
