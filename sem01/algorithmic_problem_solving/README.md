![Week 2, Lab 2 screenshot](./_screenshots/week02/screenshot.png)

#### Questions
1. Write a Pseudocode program that prints the **quotient** and **remainder** on dividing the constant **X** by the constant **Y**. X should be initialized to **5** and Y should be initialized to **3**.

    Please input hours worked: 45
    Hours worked = 45.0 hourly rate = 9.6 gross wweekly = 432.0
    ```
3. Write a Pseudocode program that **prompts** the user for **four integer values** and prints their **average**. Your program output should look as follows and you should use the test values shown.
    ```

Your program should **prompt** the user to enter the **radius** and **height** of the cylinder and should use a combination of **constants** and **variables** to calculate the volume. The following formula should be used to calculate the volume, where V=volume, r=radius and h=height:
    ```
    V = π * r² * h
    ```
    ```
    Enter the radius: 2.5

    ```
    Triangle Inequality Theorem: The sum of the two sides must be greater than the longest side.

This lab focuses on solving problems using the eliminating possibilities method. The exercises are designed to help understand the logic and structure of algorithms without getting bogged down by syntax.

![Week 9, Lab 7 screenshot](./_screenshots/week09/screenshot.png)

#### Questions
- Eliminating Possibilities
    1. SQUARE ROOTS
        - The square root of 4356 is an integer. Without a calculator, determine what that integer is by eliminating possibilities. Do the same for 8464.
    2. HOW MANY LINES?

    3. THE THREE SQUARES
        - Three cousins, Bob, Chris, and Phil, were sitting around watching football on TV. The game was so boring that they started talking about how old they were. Bob (The oldest) noticed that they were all between the ages of 11 and 30. Phil noticed that the sum of their ages was 70. Chris (The youngest) pointed out, “if you write the square of each of our ages, all the digits from 1 to 9 will appear exactly once in the digits of the three squares”. How old was each person?
- Logic
    1. THE FISHING TRIP
        - Several friends take a fishing trip every year. Each year they have a contest to see who catches the heaviest fish. The loser has to pay for all of the junk food they eat on the trip. Determine each friend’s standings in this year’s contest by using the following clues. By the way, in the tradition of fishing trips, every statement quoted here is a falsehood.
            - Marta: Mickey was first
            - Woody: I beat Sally
            - Sally: Marta beat Woody
            - Mickey: Woody was second
    2. VOLLEYBALL TEAM
        - Three friends – Elaine, Kelly, and Shannon – all start for their college volleyball team. Each plays a different position: setter, middle blocker, and outside hitter. Of the three, one is a first year, one a 2nd year, and the other is a 4th year. From the clues below, determine each woman’s position and year in college.
            1. Elaine is not the setter.
            2. Kelly has been in school longer than the middle blocker.
            3. The middle blocker has been in school longer than the outside hitter.
            4. Either Kelly is the setter or Elaine is the middle blocker.
    3. ATHLETES
        - Russ, Don, Pamela, and Yvonne are the first names of four friends who all received sports scholarships. Krieger actually has a full scholarship because he is a star in two different sports. Use the clues to determine each person’s full name.
            1. Hicks and Russ play on the same men’s volleyball team.
            2. Drake and Braun have both set women’s records in swimming.
            3. Yvonne and Drake both went to the same high school.
    4. EXPERTS
        - Abbie, Bridget, Clare, and Demi are women whose professions are water quality engineer, soil contamination scientist, air pollution consultant, and biological diversity advocate. Match each woman to her expertise using the following four clues.
            1. Bridget’s expertise is not biological diversity.
            2. Abbie loves to garden, but her expertise has nothing to do with soil or air pollution.
            3. The air pollution expert, the water quality engineer, and Demi all met one another at a global warming conference.
            4. Bridget has never met the person who works on air pollution.
- Classic Problems
    1. TURKEYS
        - Among Grandfather’s papers, a bill was found: 72 Turkeys = *€67.9*
        - The first and last digits of the number that obviously represented the total price of those fowls are replaced here by blanks, for they have faded and are now illegible. What are the two faded digits and what was the price of one turkey?
