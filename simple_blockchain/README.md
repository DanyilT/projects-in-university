You have registered for an online service that uses **hash chains** for authentication. Your account nOOB was given the seed value:
**`654e1c2ac6312d8c6441282f155c8ce9`**.

Using this information, your task is to find the predecessor hash — the value **X** such that applying the service’s hash function to **X** yields the challenge hash for user ECSC:

**`hash(X) = c89aa2ffb9edcc6604005196b5f0e0e4`**.

In other words, find the value **X** for which the service’s hash function produces **`c89aa2ffb9edcc6604005196b5f0e0e4`**. That value **X** is your solution and will let you authenticate as ECSC for this challenge.

You must submit a detailed explanation that includes the source code you used to solve the challenge.
