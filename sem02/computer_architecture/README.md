## Project
This is have to be the final project for the module.

### [Maze Runner](./assessment/01/)
**Deadline:** Monday, April 22, 2024 @ 09:00

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The project is located on [`project/year01/module-computer_architecture/maze-runner`](https://github.com/DanyilT/projects-in-university/tree/project/year01/module-computer_architecture/maze-runner) branch.  
> Please switch to this branch to see the project files.  
> This branch contains my Arduino code (.ino) and README describing the project. 

[Task](./assessment/01/computer_architecture_assessment.pdf) | [Submission](./assessment/01/submission/project_link.txt)

This is a code for Arduino Uno Vechile to navigate through a maze. The vehicle is equipped with a servo motor and whisker switches to detect obstacles and navigate around them. The code uses a combination of servo control, whisker input monitoring, and decision-making logic to guide the vehicle through the maze autonomously.

_Note: this version of the bot did not successfully complete the maze, but implements the required sensor, LED, and audio logic._
