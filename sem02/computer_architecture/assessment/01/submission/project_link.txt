Description:
This link points to the Maze Runner Arduino project created for the Year 1, Semester 2 Computer Architecture assessment. 
This branch contains my Arduino code (.ino) and README describing the project. 
Note: this version of the bot did not successfully complete the maze, but implements the required sensor, LED, and audio logic.
