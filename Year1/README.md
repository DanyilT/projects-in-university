## Year 1

### [Semester 1](Sem1)

#### [Algorithmic Problem Solving](Sem1/Algorithmic%20Problem%20Solving)

This Module provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of algorithm design and problem-solving techniques. The course covers a range of topics, including pseudocode, flowcharts, diagrams, lists, and logical reasoning. The primary goal is to develop problem-solving skills and enhance logical thinking through practical exercises and continuous assessments.

#### [Fundamentals of Programming 1](Sem1/Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%201)

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of programming using Java. The module covers basic syntax, control structures, data types, etc. The module is assessed through a series of lab exercises. Each lab exercise is designed to enhance understanding of various programming concepts and their applications in solving computational problems.

#### [Networking Basics](Sem1/Networking%20Basics)

This module provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer networks. The course covers a range of topics, including network devices, protocols, and network configuration. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of computer networks and their applications in real-world scenarios.

#### [Web Development Fundamentals](Sem1/Web%20Development%20Fundamentals)

This module covers the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and introductory JavaScript. Projects in this category aim to build a strong foundation in creating and styling web pages, as well as adding interactivity through JavaScript.

#### [Personal and Professional Development](Sem1/Personal%20and%20Professional%20Development)

This module covers personal and professional development topics, including presentations, communication skills, and teamwork. The module aims to develop students' soft skills and enhance their employability.

### [Semester 2](Sem2)

#### [Computer Architecture](Computer%20Achitecture)

This module introduces the basics of computer architecture and the principles of digital logic design. The module covers the fundamental concepts of digital systems, including binary numbers, logic gates, and Boolean algebra. The module also covers the design and implementation of combinational and sequential circuits using logic gates and flip-flops. The module includes practical activities to build and test digital circuits using breadboards and logic gates.

#### [Fundamentals of Programming 2](Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%202)

This module introduces students to the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a small network. Students learn how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. By the end of this module, students will be able to configure and troubleshoot routers and switches and resolve common issues with RIPv1, RIPv2, single-area and multi-area OSPF, virtual LANs, and inter-VLAN routing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

#### [Routers and Routing Basics](Routers%20and%20Routing%20Basics)

This module introduces students to the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a small network. Students learn how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. By the end of this module, students will be able to configure and troubleshoot routers and switches and resolve common issues with RIPv1, RIPv2, single-area and multi-area OSPF, virtual LANs, and inter-VLAN routing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

#### [Web Development Client-Side](Web%20Development%20Client-Side)

This module introduces students to the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The module covers the fundamentals of client-side web development, including the structure and design of web pages, the use of CSS for styling, and the use of JavaScript for interactivity. The module includes practical activities to build and test web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
