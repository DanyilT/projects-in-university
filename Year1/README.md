## Year 1

### [Semester 1](Sem1)

This is a collection of projects completed during my first semester (Year 1) at TU Dublin. The projects are organized by subject, showcasing a range of skills and knowledge acquired throughout my studies.

#### [Algorithmic Problem Solving](Sem1/Algorithmic%20Problem%20Solving)

This Module provides an introduction to the principles of algorithmic problem solving. The module covers the development of algorithms using pseudocode, diagrams and lists. The module also covers the use of conditional statements and logical expressions in algorithm development. The module also covers the use of systematic lists and the elimination of possibilities in problem-solving. The module also covers the use of logic in problem-solving. The module also covers the use of classic problems in problem-solving.

#### [Fundamentals of Programming 1](Sem1/Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%201)

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of programming using Java. The module covers basic syntax, control structures, data types, etc. The module is assessed through a series of lab exercises. Each lab exercise is designed to enhance understanding of various programming concepts and their applications in solving computational problems. The labs include practical tasks such as writing simple programs, using loops and conditionals, working with arrays, and performing calculations. By completing these exercises, students will gain hands-on experience and develop problem-solving skills essential for programming.

#### [Networking Basics](Sem1/Networking%20Basics)

This module provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer networks. The course covers a range of topics, including network devices, protocols, and network configuration. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of computer networks and their applications in real-world scenarios. The course also includes practical exercises to reinforce the theoretical concepts. IP addressing, subnetting, and network troubleshooting are some of the key topics covered in this module.

#### [Personal and Professional Development](Sem1/Personal%20and%20Professional%20Development)

This module covers personal and professional development topics, including presentations, communication skills, and teamwork. The module aims to develop students' soft skills and enhance their employability. Main project was to create and deliver a presentation on a topic of choice.

#### [Web Development Fundamentals](Sem1/Web%20Development%20Fundamentals)

This module covers the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and introductory JavaScript. Projects in this category aim to build a strong foundation in creating and styling web pages, as well as adding interactivity through JavaScript. The module also covers responsive design and accessibility. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of web development and its applications in real-world scenarios. The course also includes practical exercises to reinforce the theoretical concepts.

#### Computer Systems

Didn't save anything for this module.

### [Semester 2](Sem2)

This is a collection of projects completed during my second semester (Year 1) at TU Dublin. The projects are organized by subject, showcasing a range of skills and knowledge acquired throughout my studies.

#### [Computer Architecture](Sem2/Computer%20Achitecture)

This module introduces the basics of computer architecture and the principles of digital logic design. The module covers the fundamental concepts of digital systems, including binary numbers, logic gates, and Boolean algebra. The module also covers the design and implementation of combinational and sequential circuits using logic gates and flip-flops. The module includes practical activities to build and test digital circuits using breadboards and logic gates. The module also covers the basics of microcontrollers and embedded systems, including the Arduino platform. The module includes practical activities to build and test circuits using the Arduino platform and program microcontrollers to perform various tasks. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of computer architecture and its applications in real-world scenarios. Also have to be the final project for the module: write a code for Arduino Uno Vechile to navigate through a maze.

#### [Routers and Routing Basics](Sem2/Routers%20and%20Routing%20Basics)

This module introduces the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a small network. It covers how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of networking concepts and partical skills to configure a small network, including the ability to perform basic router and switch configurations. Had some hardware (real routers and switches) labs and Packet Tracer (virtual) labs.

#### [Web Development Client-Side](Sem2/Web%20Development%20Client-Side)

This module covers the basics of web development and the fundamentals of client-side web development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the primary technologies used in this module. The module covers the structure and design of web pages, the use of CSS for styling, and the use of JavaScript for interactivity. The module includes practical activities to build and test web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of web development and its applications in real-world scenarios.
