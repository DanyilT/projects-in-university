## [Semester 1](/Year1/Sem1/)

### [Algorithms](/Year1/Sem1/Algorithmic%20Problem%20Solving)

This section includes a collection of lab exercises and coursework assignments focused on algorithm design and analysis. Each project within this category is designed to enhance understanding of various algorithmic strategies, such as sorting, searching, and optimization techniques, and their applications in solving complex computational problems.

### [Programming](/Year1/Sem1/Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%201)

Projects in this semester introduce fundamental programming concepts using Java.

### [Networking](/Year1/Sem1/Networking%20Basics)

I delved into the realm of computer networks with a focus on Packet Tracer Learning. This subject provided hands-on experience with network simulation and configuration, essential for understanding the backbone of internet and intranet connections.

### [Web Development](/Year1/Sem1/Web%20Development%20Fundamentals)

This section covers the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and introductory JavaScript.

### [Personal and Professional Development](/Year1/Sem1/Personal%20and%20Professional%20Development)

Presentation about blockchain and how to hack a blockchain. Includes a .pdf for easier reading and a .pptx with annotations.

## [Semester 2](/Year1/Sem2/)

### [Computer Architecture](/Year1/Sem2/Computer%20Achitecture)

Projects related to computer architecture, including working with Arduino. This area focuses on understanding the hardware aspects of computing systems and how software interacts with hardware.

### [Programming](/Year1/Sem2/Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%202)

The second semester advances to more complex topics, such as object-oriented programming and software design principles.

### [Networking](/Year1/Sem2/Routers%20and%20Routing%20Basics)

Projects and exercises designed to deepen understanding of how routers work, their configuration, and their role in connecting different network segments. These practical exercises simulate real-world networking scenarios, allowing for a comprehensive learning experience in network topology design and troubleshooting.

### [Web Development](/Year1/Sem2/Web%20Development%20Client-Side)

Web Development projects are divided into two semesters, reflecting an introductory then advanced exploration into web technologies and frameworks. The focus is on JavaScript and more HTML and CSS.
