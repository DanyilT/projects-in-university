# Year 1 | Semester 2

> This is a collection of projects completed during my second semester (Year 1) at TU Dublin. The projects are organized by subject, showcasing a range of skills and knowledge acquired throughout my studies.

## Modules

### [Computer Architecture](Computer%20Achitecture)

This module introduces the basics of computer architecture and the principles of digital logic design. The module covers the fundamental concepts of digital systems, including binary numbers, logic gates, and Boolean algebra. The module also covers the design and implementation of combinational and sequential circuits using logic gates and flip-flops. The module includes practical activities to build and test digital circuits using breadboards and logic gates. The module also covers the basics of microcontrollers and embedded systems, including the Arduino platform. The module includes practical activities to build and test circuits using the Arduino platform and program microcontrollers to perform various tasks. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of computer architecture and its applications in real-world scenarios. Also have to be the final project for the module: write a code for Arduino Uno Vechile to navigate through a maze.

> Have a [Final Project](Computer%20Achitecture/README.md#final-project) for this module: write a code for Arduino Uno Vechile to navigate through a maze.

### [Fundamentals of Programming 2](Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%202)

This module builds on the concepts introduced in Fundamentals of Programming 1. The module covers more advanced programming topics, including arrays, classes, objects, and file handling. The primary goal is to develop problem-solving skills and enhance logical thinking through practical exercises and a final project. The final project for the module involves writing code for a Coffee Shop application that allows the user to view and order drinks.

> Have a [Final Project](Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%202/README.md#final-project) for this module: write code for a Coffee Shop application.

### [Routers and Routing Basics](Routers%20and%20Routing%20Basics)

This module introduces the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a small network. It covers how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of networking concepts and partical skills to configure a small network, including the ability to perform basic router and switch configurations. Had some hardware (real routers and switches) labs and Packet Tracer (virtual) labs.

### [Web Development Client-Side](Web%20Development%20Client-Side)

This module covers the basics of web development and the fundamentals of client-side web development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the primary technologies used in this module. The module covers the structure and design of web pages, the use of CSS for styling, and the use of JavaScript for interactivity. The module includes practical activities to build and test web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of web development and its applications in real-world scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Have a [Final Project](Web%20Development%20Client-Side/README.md#final-project) for this module: create a personal portfolio website.
