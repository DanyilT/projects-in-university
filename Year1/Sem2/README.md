# Year 1 | Semester 2

> This is a collection of projects completed during my second semester at TU Dublin. The projects are organized by subject, showcasing a range of skills and knowledge acquired throughout my studies.

## [Computer Architecture](Computer%20Achitecture)

> This module introduces the basics of computer architecture and the principles of digital logic design. The module covers the fundamental concepts of digital systems, including binary numbers, logic gates, and Boolean algebra. The module also covers the design and implementation of combinational and sequential circuits using logic gates and flip-flops. The module includes practical activities to build and test digital circuits using breadboards and logic gates.

## [Fundamentals of Programming 2](Fundamentals%20of%20Programming%202)

> This module introduces students to the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a small network. Students learn how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. By the end of this module, students will be able to configure and troubleshoot routers and switches and resolve common issues with RIPv1, RIPv2, single-area and multi-area OSPF, virtual LANs, and inter-VLAN routing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

## [Routers and Routing Basics](Routers%20and%20Routing%20Basics)

> This module introduces students to the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a small network. Students learn how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. By the end of this module, students will be able to configure and troubleshoot routers and switches and resolve common issues with RIPv1, RIPv2, single-area and multi-area OSPF, virtual LANs, and inter-VLAN routing in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

## [Web Development Client-Side](Web%20Development%20Client-Side)

> This module introduces students to the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The module covers the fundamentals of client-side web development, including the structure and design of web pages, the use of CSS for styling, and the use of JavaScript for interactivity. The module includes practical activities to build and test web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
