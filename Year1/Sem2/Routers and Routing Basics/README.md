# Routers and Routing Basics

> This module introduces the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a small network. It covers how to configure a router and a switch for basic functionality. The primary goal is to develop an understanding of networking concepts and partical skills to configure a small network, including the ability to perform basic router and switch configurations. Had some hardware (real routers and switches) labs and Packet Tracer (virtual) labs.
