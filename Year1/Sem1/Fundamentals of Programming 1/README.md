## Labs

### [Lab 1](Lab1)

This lab introduces the basics of Java programming, including setting up the development environment, writing simple programs, and understanding the compilation and execution process.

[Tasks](Lab1/Sem1-Lab1.pdf) | [Solutions .java files)](Lab1)

#### Questions

1. [Question 1](Lab1/HelloWorld.java)
    - Open a new text file in the TextPad editor and type in the following Java code. Save the file as `HelloWorld.java`. Compile and run your HelloWorld program using the command line `javac` and `java` commands.
    ```java
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }
    ```

2. [Question 2](Lab1/MyName.java)
    - Write a new Java program called `MyName.java` that prints your name to the screen. Compile and run this program from the command line using the `javac` and `java` commands.

3. [Question 3](Lab1/NewHope.java)
    - Write a Java program called `NewHope.java` that prints the following text to the screen. Compile and run this program from the command line using the `javac` and `java` commands.
    ```
    Episode IV, A NEW HOPE
    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armoured space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
    ```

4. [Question 4](Lab1/Broken.java)
    - Download the `Broken.java` source file from nowhere. Compile the program on the command line using the `javac` command. Open the `Broken.java` file in TextPad and try to fix the errors it contains, compile the code with `javac` to check for errors. When you have fixed all the errors in `Broken.java`, run the program using the `java` command.

### [Lab 2](Lab2)

This lab focuses on control structures in Java, including if-else statements, switch statements, loops, and logical operators.

#### Questions

1. [Question 1](Lab2/Question1.java)
    - Write a Java program that produces the following output. Name your program `Question1.java`.

2. [Question 2](Lab2/Question2.java)
    - Write a Java program that prints the answers to the following arithmetic expressions on separate lines. Name your program `Question2.java`.
    ```
    1. 4 x 4 = 
    2. 3 x 7 + (-2 x -8) = 
    3. (" × %)'( () × *)'+, =
    ```

3. [Question 3](Lab2/Question3.java)
    - Write a Java program that uses two variables `x` and `y` to store the values 71 and 3.14. Your program should print the values stored in `x` and `y` to the screen. Name your program `Question3.java`.

4. [Question 4](Lab2/Question4.java)
    - An employee receives an hourly rate of €9.80 and works 42 hours a week. Write a Java program that calculates the employee's gross weekly wage and prints it to the screen. Name your program `Question4.java`.

5. [Question 5](Lab2/Question5.java)
    - Given the following function `f(x) = ax^2 + bx - c`, write a Java program to evaluate `f(x)` given `x = 5`. Your program should use a variable called `x` and print the linear arithmetic expression along with the result. Name your program `Question5.java`.

#### Deliverables

Save your Java solutions to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the `Week1` folder. Zip the `Week1` folder and upload the zip file using the Week1 upload link for your group on MOODLE. Remember to only include the `.java` source files.

#### Plagiarism

This assessment should be an individual piece of work. Any evidence of plagiarism will result in a grade of zero for all parties involved and will trigger the University's plagiarism policy 3AS08 (see course coordination page).
