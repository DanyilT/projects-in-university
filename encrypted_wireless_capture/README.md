You are given a packet capture of encrypted wireless traffic. Your task is to recover any required key(s), decrypt the capture, reassemble the application-layer data, and extract the secret message hidden in the file. Use appropriate tools (hint: **aircrack-ng**) and document everything you do.

Submit a single PDF that includes:
- the recovered secret message;
- the exact commands or scripts you executed;
- full-window screenshots of the key steps; and
- a short, reproducible explanation so another student can repeat your procedure
