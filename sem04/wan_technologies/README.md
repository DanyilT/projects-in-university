WAN Technologies
Welcome to semester 4 and your next module in networking! This semester we start to look at what happens at the boundary of our LANs and how we securely connect them together. We'll be relying on lots of the foundation laid out in the previous networking modules, so hopefully you still remember some of it. Enjoy!

You will do the following:
Explain how vulnerabilities, threats and exploits can be mitigated to enhance network security
Implement standard and extended ACLs to filter traffic and secure admin access
Explain how VPNs secure site-to-site and remote access connectivity
Configure NAT services to provide IPv4 address scalability
Explain how WAN access technologies can be used to satisfy business requirements
Explain how networking devices implement QoS
Implement protocols to manage the network
Explain the characteristics of scalable network architectures
Troubleshoot enterprise networks
Explain the purpose and characteristics of network virtualisation
Explain how network automation is enabled through RESTful APIs and configuration management tools
