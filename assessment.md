# Assessment 2 - Challenge Labs 
**Assessment 2 – Challenge Labs (25%)**  
**Weeks: 9–12**  
**Deadline: 7 December, 23:59**

**📌 Target:**  
During the term, you are required to complete **any 4 out of the 6 Challenge Labs**. Some of these labs are very difficult and are harder than the normal weekly labs. If you don't succeed in completing a lab you can still score attempt marks for everything you've tried. The Challenge labs including:
1. Many Time Pad 
2. Encrypted image 
3. Breaking Salted Hashes 
4. Encrypted Evidence 
5. Encrypted Wireless Capture 
6. Simple Blockchain 

**📌 Marking Scheme**  
You may **attempt only 4 labs**.  
If you submit more than 4, **the additional labs will automatically receive 0 marks**.  
Each selected lab will be graded as follows:
| **Score** | **Description** |
|-------|-------------|
| **0 mark** | No submission or irrelevant content |
| **1 mark** | Submission provided but incomplete or largely incorrect |
| **2 marks** | All tasks attempted but not fully correct/finished; good explanation and screenshots provided |
| **3 marks** | All tasks completed correctly with detailed results, explanation and screenshots |

**📌 Submission Requirements**  
Submit a **single PDF document** via Brightspace containing the write-ups for the **4 Challenge Labs** you attempted.  
Each lab section should:
- Describe your full approach and steps used to solve the challenge.
- Explain what worked and what didn’t, showing your logic and thought process.
- Include enough detail for another student to reproduce your results.
- Contain screenshots of you running the main commands and obtaining results.

**⚠️ Important:**  
Screenshots should show the **full screen or full window** — do *not* crop or paste only single command lines or outputs.
