The attached file **aes.bmp.enc** is a BMP image that has been encrypted with **AES-ECB**. Your task is to write your **own Python script** (not copied from the internet) to analyse the file at the 16-byte block level, exploit AES-ECB characteristics (e.g. repeated blocks / block-wise patterns), and reconstruct the original BMP image (do **not** attempt to brute-force AES keys); include your commented script (or paste it in an appendix), a short description showing how to run it, full-window screenshots of key commands and intermediate outputs, and a brief reproducible write-up describing every step you tried and the final recovered image in your PDF submission.
