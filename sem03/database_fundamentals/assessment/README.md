## 📄 Assessment Brief
**Brief File:**  
[`database_fundamentals_assessment.pdf`](./01/database_fundamentals_assessment.pdf)

This assessment requires the design and implementation of a comprehensive database system for a university office. The project encompasses the full database development lifecycle:

**Key Requirements:**
- **Database Design:** Create conceptual, logical, and physical ERD models for a university office system
- **Normalization:** Apply normalization principles to ensure database integrity and eliminate redundancy
- **Implementation:** Develop DDL statements to create tables, define relationships, and enforce constraints
- **Data Management:** Write DML statements to populate the database with sample data
- **Query Development:** Create 20 complex SQL queries demonstrating various techniques including:
  - Multi-table joins
  - Aggregate functions and GROUP BY clauses
  - Subqueries and nested queries
  - Advanced filtering and conditional logic
  - Data retrieval optimization

**Database Entities Include:**
- Students and Student Enrollments
- Academic Programs and Courses
- Faculty and Staff Management
- Department Organization
- Course Schedules and Registrations
