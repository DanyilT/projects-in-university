This is a 90-minute exam (mixed question types). 
Attempt ALL questions
You have one attempt - please check all entered answers before you submit.
Students must hand up written work showing how the solution was reached for all questions involving calculations. For the final result - no marks can be awarded where written work is not submitted. Where a calculation error is made (the submitted answer is incorrect) I will be able to check the rough work for the method used to award some marks.
