> [!TIP]  
> `with_references_to_raw_files`
> – That means the .md file can be downloaded just as one file and it will take references to the files from github site, but not from the actual repository structure.  
> E.g. images will be referenced as `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanyilT/projects-in-university/refs/heads/assessment/year03/module-secure_communications/challenge-labs/README.md` instead of `./README.md`.
