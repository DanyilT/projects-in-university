Hi all,

There's a change to the schedule this coming Friday (21st).

Ciarán Cotter is returning to host a Bug Bounty hands-on lab, where you'll get to hunt for security bugs through the Bord Gáis bug bounty programme. This is a great opportunity for you to learn some real-world bug bounty/ ethical hacking skills from a very skilled & experienced professional.

Your attendance/ participation will be graded as part of your lab assessment for Secure Programming.

The labs will take place in A11 and will last approximately 2-2.5 hours. I have combined you into groups of 2 as follows:

Group 1 and Group  3: 11 - 1.30pm
Group 2 and Group 4: 2 - 4.30pm

Please install and familiarise yourselves with the following tools as you will be using them:
	Install the Project Discovery Tool Manager (PDTM) found here: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/pdtm 
	Then using PDTM, the following should be installed (by running pdtm -i <tool name>):
		Subfinder
		Naabu
		HTTPX
		URLFinder
	Install Caido: https://caido.io/ - you can get FULL ACCESS to the Pro version as a student.

The rough plan of the workshop is to use these tools to dissect Bord Gáis's scope.

Please note, there will be no lecture on Friday to facilitate the labs.


Best regards,


Stephen
